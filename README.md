# The Yellow Button

Welcome to **The Yellow Button**! 🎉

Ever wondered what could be the most thrilling thing in life? Neither did I, so I created **The Yellow Button**. And here it is—a yellow button. Yes, just a yellow button. Anything more? Exactly. That’s it!

This app was **inspired by KuroJam 2024**, a hackathon with the random theme of "Something Yellow." Although I didn't participate in the hackathon due to time constraints, I was motivated by the theme and decided to create something fun and utterly simple.

## What Does This Button Do?

1. **Press the Yellow Button**. That’s all you need to do.
2. Every time you press the button, your counter goes up. Congratulations! 🎉
3. But wait, there’s a twist: there’s a small chance your counter might reset to 0. It’s like a gamble, but with no prizes or rewards, just a yellow button. 😆

## Attention!

The chances of reaching the highest score of 99 are so minuscule that you’d have better luck finding a unicorn in your backyard. 🦄✨ In real terms, the probability is 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000093, or one in 1 tredecillion. Yes, you read that right—tredecillion! 🌌

## How It Works

This yellow button is here to entertain you with its sleek design and extremely limited functionality. But don’t worry, it’s a unique experience with absolutely no stress involved. What more could you ask for? 🤷‍♂️

## Contributions

There’s not much to do here, but if you have ideas to improve the yellow button experience, we’d love to hear your suggestions! Just remember, the yellow button is what it is. 😉

Enjoy pressing the yellow button and keep your expectations at their lowest! 🚀
