Welcome to **The Yellow Button**! 🎉

Ever wondered what could be the most thrilling thing in life? Neither did I, so I created **The Yellow Button**. And here it is—a yellow button. Yes, just a yellow button. Anything more? Exactly. That’s it!

This app was **inspired by KuroJam 2024**, a hackathon with the random theme of "Something Yellow." I managed to participate in the Jam, and although the project was developed in a rush, I wanted to add a touch of humor and simplicity to the theme.

## What Does This Button Do?

1. **Press the Yellow Button**. That’s all you need to do.
2. Every time you press the button, your counter goes up. Congratulations! 🎉
3. But wait, there’s a twist: there’s a small chance your counter might reset to 0. It’s like a gamble, but with no prizes or rewards, just a yellow button. 😆

## Future Features

Currently, **The Yellow Button** doesn’t save player progress in any way, not even in local storage. This choice is intentional to prevent cheating and keep the experience straightforward. However, I have exciting plans for future updates:

- **Backend Implementation**: To handle player progress and make the game more engaging, I plan to implement a backend.
    - **Social Media Login**: Log in with social media accounts to save your progress and track your achievements.
    - **Leaderboard**: Compete with other players and see who has the highest score on the leaderboard.
    - **Fun Messages and Data**: Occasionally, the bottom of the screen will display funny messages to add a bit of humor to the app. Additionally, I plan to show interesting data retrieved from the backend in these messages, such as the total number of times all players have pressed the button.

Please note, this project was created in just about half an hour for the Jam. I aimed to bring a bit of humor to the event, and I’m excited to enhance it further in the future!

## Attention!

The chances of reaching the highest score of 99 are so minuscule that you’d have better luck finding a unicorn in your backyard. 🦄✨ In real terms, the probability is 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000093, or one in 1 tredecillion. Yes, you read that right—tredecillion! 🌌

## How It Works

This yellow button is here to entertain you with its sleek design and extremely limited functionality. But don’t worry, it’s a unique experience with absolutely no stress involved. What more could you ask for? 🤷‍♂️

## Contributions

There’s not much to do here, but if you have ideas to improve the yellow button experience, we’d love to hear your suggestions! Just remember, the yellow button is what it is. 😉

Enjoy pressing the yellow button and keep your expectations at their lowest! 🚀
